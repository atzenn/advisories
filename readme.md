## SSD Secure Disclosure

> SSD helps security researchers turn their skills in uncovering security vulnerabilities into a career.
Designed by researchers, for researchers, SSD provides the fast response and support needed to get zero-day vulnerabilities responsibly reported to vendors and to get researchers the compensation they deserve. We help researchers get to the bottom of vulnerabilities affecting major operating systems, software or devices.

## The SSD Community

> As part of our vulnerability disclosure program we have established a community of researchers. We believe in long-term investment in this group and we provide the tools, education and knowledge they need to find more vulnerabilities and advanced attack vectors and discover innovative ways to exploit them.

> We sponsor researcher’s workshops, courses, software licenses, hardware and conference attendance.

> We are always looking for new researchers to join our community. That’s why we are promoting our “Friend Bring Friend” program. When you refer us a new researcher that starts working with us on Operating systems / Mobile / Web Browsers – you get 10,000$ USD / For other vulnerabilities – you get 1,000$ USD

> As another way to support the international community we sponsor security conferences around the world – from Black Hat USA to community conferences such as DefCamp Romania. We publish vulnerability technical information in our blog (https://ssd-disclosure.com/index.php/advisories), on Twitter (@SecuriTeam_SSD) and in vendor advisories. We also give lectures and host hacking competitions at international security conferences.

> In 2018 we sponsored and some of our researchers attended:
    OffensiveCon
    Hack In The Box
    Zer0con
    CanSec

## Q&A

- **How much can I earn from working with you?** The amount paid depends on two different variables:

    - How widespread is the software/hardware? Popular products typically reach higher amounts.
    - How critical is the vulnerability? For example, if you find an unauthenticated arbitrary code execution vulnerability, you would be paid substantially more than for a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability.

- **What if I want to stay anonymous?**
    - Fine by us! A lot of our researchers choose to stay anonymous.

- **What is your policy regarding privacy and confidentiality of researcher’s information?**
    - We take the privacy of researchers very seriously and do not disclose to any third party (including to customers) any personal information about researchers such as names, aliases, email addresses, bank details, or any other personal or confidential information.

- **What is the difference between SSD and Bug Bounties or other programs?**
    - Financially:
        - We pay more than bug bounty programs.
        - If a vendor doesn’t have a bug bounty program – we are still interested in acquiring the vulnerability and reporting it to the vendor.
        - We believe researchers need to get paid for their effort and we are willing to offer higher rewards.
    - Administratively:
        - We will handle all the reporting process.
        - We will publish your research and attribute it per your instructions.
- **How do I submit my questions or research?**
    - Send us an email contact@ssd-disclosure.com – It’s that easy!
